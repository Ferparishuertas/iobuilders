## 1. Tech and architecture

## 1.1 Frontend

When developing a mobile app for both Android and IOS, there are two ways of approaching. 
As they are very different systems, it is usually necessary to have two different teams with experts in each technology.
On the other hand, a hybrid technology could be used to avoid duplicate codes for the same app and work with only one team.
Since this is a POC with little time to be develop, I would choose a hybrid technology as React Native. 
It uses native UI controllers which improves the performance of the app compared to other hybrid technologies.

## 1.2 Backend

As a backend architecture, I would choose the micro-service architecture since all the components have to be reusable and 
independent. 
The framework I would propose for this would be Spring Boot framework with Java as language. Java and Spring 
are very popular and used with a large community so it is easier to find professionals who are familiar with these technologies.

For the communication between services I would choose Apache Kafka. It is easy to configurate and integrate with Spring projects.
You can also subscribe to these communications so you can audit every single message between the services.

## 2. Team

For this project the team we need would be:

* 1 Project Manager/Scrum Master

* 1 UI/UX Designer

* 1 Senior Frontend

* 1 Junior Frontend

* 2 Senior Backend (Experience in blockchain or bankind desirable)

* 2 Junior Backend (Experience working with Java and Spring desirable)

## 3. Culture

## 3.1 Methodology

In this case, I would choose agile methodologies, such as Scrum. Constant communication between the members of the team is 
the key to success. Daily meetings where each member can participate.

## 3.2 Culture

* Open-minded and good vibes. It is always easier to work when you get along with your teammates.

* Continuous learning. In this ever-changing industry you can easily be left behind without continuous improvement.

* Remote work friendly, always respecting the personal life.
