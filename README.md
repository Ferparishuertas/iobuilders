Tokenized Money PoC

#### Author: Juan Jos√© Maldonado Illescas

This is a document responding to the Iobuilders Challenge Tokenized Money Poc.

## Overall Architecture

The architecture will be an event-driven architecture based on microservices with event sourcing, so we can get a loosely coupled,
scalability and reusability of these components.

Thanks to the event-driven and event sourcing we will achieve a great traceability about everything that happened in the system, 
allowing us to build new services in the future very easily, reconstructing everything that has happened in the system at some point.

## Tech risks

Some risks I found could be:

- Integration with third parties. For me this is one of the biggest challenges, because normally while integrating with third parties, problems come up. Even though you work with a
contract, in the real integration problems easily happen, and in this POC we have a lot of third parties, Momopocket, Inversis, KYC checking company, Iberpay, etc.

- Security has to be a top priority in this project, because we are working with money. Connections with mobile client app, internal connections, connections with third parties, etc.
 We need to be sure that the protocols described in the requirements are complied.

- Find profiles in some tech areas could be challenging.

## Mobile app 

The client-server communication would be through REST. Authorization will be based on OAuth2 protocol.

The technology used would be in two different ways.

One is creating native applications, one for IOS and one for Android, but I discard this solution because it is a POC and the cost of hiring two separate developers
could be too much. 

Instead, we could create hybrid applications using react native or flutter, so with only one application we could work with both operating systems. The main problem of flutter
is finding a developer who knows dart, in comparison with javascript and react itself, which is easier.

So I would go with React Native, even though we sacrifice performance and UX, related to native applications.

## Backend

I am not going to describe the application microservices in detail, but I will give a general outline of it.

I identify a few domains like transactions, banking, wallet and tokens.

Everything described, would be containerized and managed by Kubernetes.

These are some technologies I would use.

- The creation for the microservices will be based on **Spring Boot** and the whole suite when needed with **Java 11/17**.
- As we have a event-driven architecture, we need a queue technology and as we have event sourcing, I would go with **Kafka**.
- In the data part I would go with **PostgreSQL** as is almost the standard nowadays.
- For the entry point of the backend, I would define an **API Gateway** and would be **Kong** because it's open source and is commonly used nowadays, in combination with **keycloak** as an identity provider.
- For monitoring, centralized logging, etc, I would go with **ELK**. 
- For distributed tracing I would go with **Jaeger** as it was built on the Opentracing standard and it's compatible with Elasticsearch.
- For monitoring metrics I would go with **Prometheus** and **Grafana**, just activating the spring actuator we can easily have it.
- I would put as well a **Sonar** with a basic configuration very easily.
- In CICD I would choose **Jenkins** with **Git**.

This could be setup with charts of **Helm**. 

These are some considerations related to technology

- DDD.
- SOLID principles, Clean Code, FIRST principles, Hexagonal architecture.
- TDD
- Even though it's a POC, I would try to go with ATDD, so the PO would create the gherkin files and the development team would implement this with Cucumber. The alignment between the business team and the technology team will increase a lot, bringing a lot of benefits.
- For unit testing would go with **Junit** and **Mockito**, the integration test I would use the tool spring has **SpringBootTest**.
- The development will go API first, using **OpenAPI** for REST and **AsyncAPI** for the messaging.
- Even though we have an event-driven architecture, there is some part were synchronous communication is mandatory, like instant transfers.
- The complexity of having an event-driven architecture will increase, so the team should be aware of eventual consistency when developing, maybe implementing the SAGA pattern when needed.
- **Feign** will be used for generating REST clients for controlling retries, timeouts, etc.
- I'm a big fan of master-only git workflow.
- NOT using Lombok nor MapStruct/ModelMapper.

Related to integration with third parties, a microservice adapter for each third would be very beneficial for reusability and separation of responsibilities.

## Cloud disclaimer

As you can see throughout the document, I have not mentioned anything about cloud solutions. In a POC I consider keep it simple and stick to kubernetes on promise and migrate in the future, but if I had to choose
it would be AWS because it is the most commonly used solution.

I would make changes in the technology used for tools of AWS.

- AWS Api Gateway instead of Kong
- AWS Cognito for Keycloak
- AWS RDS for databases

...

## Team

- 1 Product Owner ( If ATDD is chosen, with knowledge in gherkin )
- 1 Architect with knowledge in Devops ( and cloud if AWS is chosen )
- 2 Senior frontend developers with knowledge in React Native.
- 2 Senior backend developers.
- 1 Blockchain Developer ( Senior? Junior? ).
- 1 QA. ( If ATDD is chosen, maybe the need for a QA would be discussed, maybe not 100%, because the product owner would do that job).


## Culture

- A methodology of Agile will be used like Scrum for a fast development and delivery of the product.
- The time of the sprint will be 2 weeks ( I prefer normally 3 weeks, but in a POC is better 2 weeks in my opinion) , with 15 min dailies.
- Typical SCRUM meetings such as planning, refinement, review, etc. will be held.
- Project management tools will be used like Jira/Trello.
- For me democratizing knowledge is key, so both developers know about every part of the project.
- Remote work, flexible hours, team work.
- Good communication between the business part and developer part.
