### 1.1 Risks
I identify 2 main risks in the development of this POC: security and connectivity. To cover the first risk we will need a role in the team with knowledge about cibersecurity and another role with experience in Bank services.

To avoid problems of connectivity we should try to guarantee that the services will never stop, having more than one server located in different places, with some kind of balancer to try to distribute the traffic between all the servers.
### 1.2 Architecture
I would choose an hexagonal architecture with microservices. 

The hexagonal architecture gives us modularity for possible future changes and makes easier the testing tasks. By using microservices we can divide the application in different reusable components.
### 1.3 Technologies
#### Front-end:
I think React Native is a good option because it is a very extended technology, with a big community of developers and allows us to develop the Mobile Wallet App for IOS and Android.
#### Back-end: 
I would choose Spring Boot to develop our microservices application because, like React Native, is a very extended framework  and additionally it can provide auditing options.

### 2.1 Roles
-Project lead

-Product Owner

-Cibersecurity consultant with experience in banking industry

-UX/UI designer

-Front-end developer

-Back-end developer

-QA tester

One team member could have more than 1 of these roles.
### 2.2 Team size and skills
I think that for this and for any other project the main skills in a team should be teamwork, respect and proactivity. Of course technical skills are also needed, but that will depend on the people who are part of the team.

The team size, as I would use agile methodologies like Scrum, should be between 6 and 9 people. It also depends on the budget of the project. But as in this exercise the budget was not mentioned, I would organize a team of 9 people, because with more people the project would be finished earlier and you can divide the different roles and tasks more efficiently.

#### 3 Culture
I would like to follow agile methodologies in the development of projects. In this case I would use Scrum. Since the maximum time to develop the POC is 4 months, we could perform 8 sprints of 2 weeks per sprint. This methodology would help to mantain all the team updated with the daily meetings and also allow every member to participate and give their opinion in the retrospective and sprint review meetings.

I think it is important to build full-stack teams for 2 reasons. First of all, because the team would have the knowledge to work in all the application layers and will be more efficient. Secondly, because every team member can learn from the rest of the team.

For me it is also important a flexible schedule to allow the team to adapt their work hours with their personal life, making them more efiicient and comfortable.

For the same reason I would allow working remotely. Each case is different and it can be adapted to each personal circunstances, but I prefer to have a mix between working presentially in the office and remotely, because for me is important the personal relationship between all the team members.

To finish, I would help the team to keep learning, allowing some days of study of new technologies or giving some days per year to attend tech events. Another possibility is to organize talks where any team member can explain a new functionality or a personal project using technologies that could be interesting to use in the future. This way they can show the rest of team how he or she did it and how it could be used in the future projects of the team/company.
