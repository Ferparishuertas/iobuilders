# Tech + Architecture


## Tech risks:

* Smart contracts design.
* Ethereum expertise.
* Security: private keys(message bróker like ActiveMQ), testing environments, login integrations (OAuth, Auth0…).

## Tech stack:

* Hybrid mobile apps for iOS and Android:
	* No single webview as an app. 
	* Native API Access & native User Interfaces.
	* many alternatives: Nativescript with typescript & Angular, ReactNative, Xamarin.
* Backend and API:
	* API first with OpenAPI/Swagger.
	* Java microservices with Spring Boot / Nodejs microservices with express.js.
	* Couchbase database (not only SQL) and Redis for caches.
	* Not "on premise" solutions.No datacenters -> Cloud solutions :  There are many valid solutions like Openshift dedicated, Faas (Function as a service) with AWS Lambda or PaaS with Heroku.
	* CI/CD stack: Git (Bitbucket cloud/Gitlab or Github depends of Enterprise philosophy), Jenkins, Jfrog Artifactory Pro with apps deployed as dockers. AWS Device Farm.
	* Social and tasks: Jira cloud, slack.
	* Infrastructure Monitoring with TICK Stack and Kafka
	* Mobile app monitoring like newrelic.
