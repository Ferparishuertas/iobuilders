# (1) What are your thoughts, ideas about tech, architecture with this context?
As far as I’m concerned, technology is the present and future axis around which the world rounds and it becomes every day more essential in our day to day life. I’ve always understood technology as a tool to help or facilitate people life by making daily tasks easier. Regarding architecture, it seems to me it’s the most important point an application or a web must be aimed to because the success of a project depends mainly on it. Furthermore, of course, other several very important factors must be taken into account to enhance the functioning. However, if architecture isn’t well defined it doesn’t exist the application. In this sense, in my opinion, a good architecture is the base of a project’s good definition.    

# (2) Describe the skills, roles and team size, that you think is the best fit for this project.
In my view, one of the best ways to implement a good working culture and to create a good development environment may be focused in the following items:
•	The use of agile methodologies like Scrum or XP
•	Arranging daily meetings where each member of the team can contribute with ideas, evolutions or problems improving the teamwork capacity. In these meeting everyone can provide the project with their perspective from different points of view. 
•	Creating tasks springs with targets set to achieve. Regarding this, it’s important to define a timeline and to promote the constant support between team members.
In my opinion, these are the most important items to develop a project in a positive and effective way.


# (3) Go into the details, about which tech/business methodologies, tools, etc..., you think fit best to the scenario, and the culture you like and makes sense to apply on this company
As I said in the previous answer, I would try to apply agile methodologies as Scrum or XP which are compatible with each other in the moment of a project execution. As far as i’m concerned the addition of both is a good solution to ensure a balance between a good execution and a good result, keeping the aims and a good work environment which are the main items to achieve the success of the project according my view.    

The Scrum roles would be: 

•  An owner product, Scrum master (development team leader) and the development team. 

•  The important points to apply in an agile methodology like Scrum are the definition of the project timeline and the definition of sprints (normally, they are stablished by weeks or months depending on the complexity of the aim).

•  Different blocks, identified by a supervisor or a representative, could be delivered in each sprint. 

•  Daily or weekly meetings with defined timings and standardized tasks could be arranged with project managers.  

•  Tasks could be shown in a visual panel with control charts and the progress state of the project (I’ve knowledge about trello and jira as a tools).

•  An iteration could be done and a team task (development team) could be defined for each sprint.

•  It’s a teamwork so every member could contribute and decisions should be taken jointly. 

•  The owner product would be the responsible of coordinating project requirements and the responsible for ensuring the implementation of requirements by development team, both at economical and timing level.  

•  Project documentation in each process is very important for the evolution of the project and future projects.

Regarding development, it seems to me that application of the new version of Ionic 5.0 could be interesting. According my information is a hybrid and modern application totally compatible with ReactJS and I think it would be interesting to implement it because of compatibility with IOS and Android systems. As far as I’m concerned it makes the implementation of native applications easier thanks to functionalities it provides to front-end ReactJS.    

In my opinion, other interesting tool to use and to optimize development could be RabbitMQ which could be used for requests control and managing. This tool also avoid front-end blocks because it manages requests received from clients in an orderly way.   

Other interesting tool could be the implementation of a load balancer which could provide systems area with stability. Its function would be maintaining stable the application while receiving several requests to the same service. It would work as a bottle neck in a same place so it would always keep stable.

Regarding architecture, it seems to me that it would be very interesting to apply a dockerize microservices structure in order to achieve a complete functionality where every micro service could do an specific function and could also connect with other services.    

Anyway and even thought I said before, I think the most adequate procedure to begin a project is using a monolithic structure and implement new functionalities with a dockerize microservices structure as it grows because the cost would be lower and we could check the project evolution and the need it requires.

In a long-term, i would like very much to learn tecnologies like blockchain because, in my opinion, everything will be managed in a safety way in the future. Thinking on spreading of 5G technology, encryption techniques will be very important in future. It will be very necessary security in every process executed by web or mobile.
