POC Ideas
thoughts
First thoughts about this POC, which is similar to other applications in the world market, what improvements can we make to have characteristics that other applications in the world do not have.

Technological risks
-Risk of Filtering bank information.
-Risks of updating the application with respect to time.
-Risks with Ddos attacks.
-Protection risks for users' personal information.

Key Components
The most important components of this POC would be:
-The component where the user's personal information would be seen, such as bank details, data provided in the KyC system, etc.

-Component dedicated to the KyC system, important because this will prevent the creation of multiple accounts in the application for probably illegal purposes.

-Component for everything related to sending money, either in foreign currency or cryptocurrency tokens, this component must show important data such as to whom the money or token will be sent, which will be the id of this transaction for historical purposes , the conversion of money in case money is being sent between different currencies or tokens, etc.

-Private component (only for developers) with an interface that can help to monitor all transactions, this is extremely important since you are working with real money and this can lead to many problems with customers if a mistake or trying to do something illegal like money laundering.

-Component where the user sees their bank status within the account, where they can verify their transactions, movement history and money withdrawal.

-Component where the user can withdraw their money to the IBAN account or credit card that they provided us at the time of creating their account.

-Finally, all these components must have a responsive design to be used on mobile phones or, failing that, and better yet, have their own app for Android and iOS where they can do all these transactions from the comfort of their mobile phones.

Technologies to use
-For the Front end part it would work with HTML5, CSS3, Sass, Javascript, the React.js library.

-For the Backend part we have many options, we can Backend with node, with python, PHP with Laravel or even java.

-Unit testing can be done with jenkins, this to verify that our old code continues to work when the application grows and more code has to be written.

-For computer security against Ddos attacks, the knowledge of the Cisco Certified Entry Networking Technician (CCNA) would be used.

-For the development of mobile applications in android they would be done with Java and in ios they would be done with Objective C or Swift.

-Agile mythologies (Scrum) would be used throughout the project, this to be able to work in a more efficient way and if we want to make any change or detect an error in the process, this can be resolved more quickly.

Equipment
In order to complete this project, which would be of utmost importance to the company, since if the company is successful, it will be able to gain great recognition, thus attracting more clients and potential investors, an approximate team with these knowledge and skills would be needed.

-1 or 2 Frot end developers in case they want to be sure to finish the job with a good margin of time.

-1 Back end to handle everything related to the REST API and the application databases.

-1 Devops manager to manage the databases, automate the deployment and testing processes.

-1 Product owner who should know the whole project in general to be able to work as team manager.

-1 IOS developer and 1 Android developer for the mobile application or failing that one that manages both IOS as Android but this would be more expensive.

-If you opt for multiplatform with the 2 Frontend developers, it should be more than enough for this.

Personal point of view regarding culture
-The type of personnel we need.

-Personal (professional) goals for each individual are extremely important.

- E-learning must be tattooed on each worker, the best professionals never stop learning, only in that way the startups grow exponentially.
